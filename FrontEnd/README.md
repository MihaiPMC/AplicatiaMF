# MailFlow

MailFlow is an internal tool to streamline event outreach, company relationship management and interaction tracking (calls, emails, meetings & notes).

## Tech Stack
- Angular 20 (standalone APIs, signals)
- TypeScript
- RxJS

## Development

Start a local dev server:
```bash
npm start
```
Then open http://localhost:4200/

## Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Artifacts are emitted to `dist/`.

## Test
```bash
npm test
```

## Project Scripts
- `start` – dev server
- `build` – production build
- `watch` – build in watch mode
- `test` – unit tests (Karma/Jasmine)

## Notes
This README was updated for the MailFlow rebrand. Previous references to the old name were removed from the UI (except intentional event labels).
